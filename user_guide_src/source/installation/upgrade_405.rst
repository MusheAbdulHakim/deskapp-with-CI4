Upgrading from 4.0.4 to 4.0.5

**Cookie SameSite support**

CodeIgniter 4.0.5 introduces a setting for the cookie SameSite attribute. Prior versions did not set this
attribute at all. The default setting for cookies is now `Lax`. This will affect how cookies are handled in
cross-domain contexts and you may need to adjust this setting in your projects. Separate settings in `app/Config/App.php`
exists for Response cookies and for CSRF cookies.

For additional information, see `MDN Web Docs <https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite>`_.
The SameSite specifications are described in `RFC 6265 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265>`_
and the `RFC 6265bis revision <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis/?include_text=1>`_.

**Message::getHeader(s)**

The HTTP layer is moving towards `PSR-7 compliance <https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/>`_. Towards this end
``Message::getHeader()`` and ``Message::getHeaders()`` are deprecated and should be replaced
with ``Message::header()`` and ``Message::headers()`` respectively. Note that this pertains
to all classes that extend ``Message`` as well: ``Request``, ``Response`` and their subclasses.

Additional related deprecations from the HTTP layer:

* ``Message::isJSON``: Check the "Content-Type" header directly
* ``Request[Interface]::isValidIP``: Use the Validation class with ``valid_ip``
* ``Request[Interface]::getMethod()``: The ``$upper`` parameter will be removed, use str_to_upper()
* ``Request[Trait]::$ipAddress``: This property will become private
* ``Request::$proxyIPs``: This property will be removed; access ``config('App')->proxyIPs`` directly
* ``Request::__construct()``: The constructor will no longer take ``Config\App`` and has been made nullable to aid transition
* ``Response[Interface]::getReason()``: Use ``getReasonPhrase()`` instead
* ``Response[Interface]::getStatusCode()``: The explicit ``int`` return type will be removed (no action required)

**ResponseInterface**

This interface intends to include the necessary methods for any framework-compatible response class.
A number of methods expected by the framework were missing and have noe been added. If you use any
classes the implement ``ResponseInterface`` directly they will need to be compatible with the
updated requirements. These methods are as follows:

* ``setLastModified($date);``
* ``setLink(PagerInterface $pager);``
* ``setJSON($body, bool $unencoded = false);``
* ``getJSON();``
* ``setXML($body);``
* ``getXML();``
* ``send();``
* ``sendHeaders();``
* ``sendBody();``
* ``setCookie($name, $value = '', $expire = '', $domain = '', $path = '/', $prefix = '', $secure = false, $httponly = false, $samesite = null);``
* ``hasCookie(string $name, string $value = null, string $prefix = ''): bool;``
* ``getCookie(string $name = null, string $prefix = '');``
* ``deleteCookie(string $name = '', string $domain = '', string $path = '/', string $prefix = '');``
* ``getCookies();``
* ``redirect(string $uri, string $method = 'auto', int $code = null);``
* ``download(string $filename = '', $data = '', bool $setMime = false);``

To facilitate use of this interface these methods have been moved from the framework's ``Response`` into a ``ResponseTrait``
which you may use, and ``DownloadResponse`` now extends ``Response`` directly to ensure maximum compatibility.
